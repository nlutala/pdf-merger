# pdf-merger
A script that combines multiple PDFs together to make 1 merged PDF

## Description
This program was created to help me build on object-oriented programming concepts, automated testing as well as files and directories.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
* Please ensure that you have Python version 3 installed on your computer. If you have not yet got the link, you can find the latest version of Python available using this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Installing
* Open https://github.com/nlutala/pdf-merger/ in a new tab.
* Press the green "<> Code" button and press "Download ZIP"
* Once downloaded, extract all files to a new folder
* Open your preferred terminal (command prompt, windows powershell etc.) in the directory where the requirements.txt file is located and write: ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
* Now you should have all the required libraries to run the project

### Before executing the program
Ensure you have 2 or more PDF files in the directory the pdf_merger.py file is in.
It doesn't matter if you don't as the script is written to handle for these cases.

### Executing the program
* To run the script, write the following command in the terminal: ``` python pdf_merger.py ```
* You will then be presented with this screen and prompted to enter the name of the new merged file. You will then be able to find this file in a new folder called "merged-files". Your original PDF files will also be moved a new folder called "original-files".

I hope this script is useful!

### Other comments
While testing this script on my computer, I have found that merging some PDF files could result in text being printed to the terminal. This can be ignored as a new merged PDF file is generated.
